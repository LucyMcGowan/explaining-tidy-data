#### <span style="color: purple;">**Tidy Data**</span>

**Recall:** When organizing data sets, we can represent the underlying data in numerous ways depending on where we choose to format each values into rows and columns.

<span style="color: teal;">**Why make your data tidy?**</span>

1. A uniform and organized data structure makes it easier to figure out which tools work best with it.

2. Placing variables in columns allows built-in R functions to work with vectors of the data and transform tidy data. 


<span style="color: teal;">**What makes a Dataset Tidy?**</span>

1.	Each variable must have its own column.

2.	Each observation must have its own row.

3.	Each value must have its own cell.
